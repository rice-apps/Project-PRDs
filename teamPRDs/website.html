<h1 style="font-family:monaco;letter-spacing: -1px;"><b>WEBSITE</code></b></h1>
<p><i>
  <center>Creating a new frontend application and a unique brand identity for RiceApps</center>
</i></p><hr>
<h3 style="font-family:sabon; letter-spacing: 1px;"><b>Problem</code></b></h3>
<!--<p><center><q><small>Bulky design and ineffecient communcation</small></q></center></p>-->
<p><i>The problems we have can be classified into two broad categories:</i></p>
1. The information related to RiceApps on the current website is not <b>accessible</b> and <b>organized</b> enough. We need to add new information that consists of:<blockquote><p>1) Ongoing <code>projects</code> with relevant <code>sources</code></p>
<p>2) Information on club's <code>student body</code></p>
<p>3) Other CS related <code>opportunities</code>, <code>activities</code>, or <code>organizations</code></p></blockquote>
2. The current website does not reflect the <b>identity</b> of RiceApps in a <b>unique</b> way. We need to improve the design of the website by:<blockquote><p>1) Eliminating information other than <code>navigation bar</code> and <code>logo</code> on our <code>homepage</code>.</p>
<p>2) Having a <code>cleaner</code> and more <code>distinctive</code> design for the homepage.</p>
<p>3) Having a few <code>theme colors</code> for the whole site.</p>
<p>4) Creating some <code>interactive features</code>.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 style="font-family:sabon;letter-spacing: 1px;"><b>Users</code></b></h3>
<i>Our users involve a broad spectrum of <b>students</b> and <b>employers</b>:</i>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <code>Prospective students</code> looking to gain information about RiceApps</p>
<p>2. <code>Current students</code> interested in ongoing CS related <code>projects/events/opportunities</code></p>
<p>3. <code>Employers</code> interested in RiceApps projects</p>
</blockquote><p>We will be specifically targetting at current Rice students interested in ongoing CS related projects/events/opportunities. Catering to this group's needs first, we will then try to diversify and include our other target users, namely employers and prospective students.</p>
<hr>
<h3 style="font-family: sabon;letter-spacing: 1px;"><b>Needs</b></h3>
<p>One of the most important information we need to have on our website is RiceApps vision and mission statement. It is the first thing those who have no knowledge of RiceApps will be looking for when they open our website and it tells people the reason RiceApps is founded and its short and long-term goals.</p>
<p>Besides that, additional information such as achievements and history of the club can be added to give people a more comprehensive idea of RiceApps.</p>
<p>After having a basic idea of what RiceApps is, students might care most about the projects club members are doing. For each project, the website should involve relevant information on:<blockquote><p>1. The purpose of conducting this project and some general descriptions, in other words, reasons of developing this application or disadvantages of the current application. </p><p>2. Team leaders and team members.</p><p>3. Sources/links/references for those who want to check the technical details of the project.</p><p>4. The evolution process of the project in case that anyone is curious of how the project, starting from little, has come this far.</p><p>5. Images related to the project.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>For people who have questions or suggestions for RiceApps, or those who want to cooperate with RiceApps, a page with contact information is necessary. Useful information includes address of RiceApps, chairs’ emails and phone numbers, and a suggestion box.</p>
<p>For students who have general questions or want to join RiceApps, a FAQ page might be helpful.<blockquote><p>1. Information regarding how to apply for RiceApps.</p><p>2. Information regarding how to submit the projects that people want us to do.</p><p>3. Other General questions and answers.</p></blockquote></p>


<hr>

<h3 style="font-family: sabon;letter-spacing: 1px;"><b>Features</b></h3>
<i>We want to implement certain <b>core</b> features in our first prototype and develop more features with <b>successive iterations.</b></i>
<h5>Basic features for a user-friendly design:</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. Instead of having a one-page website, we will design a more flexible website that have multiple pages.</p>
  <p>2. In order to make the website look cooler and more like a technology site, we are going to have a white or black canvas and implement more interactive features like animations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Basic structure of the website:</h5>
<p>To show the identity of RiceApps better, there will only be two things on our homepage: the navigation bar and the logo of RiceApps.
The navigation bar will lead the viewers to five separate pages: <code>About Us Page, Projects Page, Events Page, Contact Us Page, and FAQ Page.</code>These subpages are going to include a blockquote commenting on Rice Apps.<ol>
 <li>About Us Page, with the mission, vision, and history of RiceApps, and possibly a letter from the chair.</li> 
 <li>Project Page<blockquote><ul><li>Projects will be displayed as tiles on this page. When users hover on these tiles, they can change into cooler shapes. </li><li>Each project will have its name, image, short descriptions, and a link to its own page on its tile.</li><li>For the separate pages for each projects, we will have <code>descriptions(namely, why are we doing this project?), team members’ names, images and emails, external links and sources, technology the project involves, a timeline showing the evolving process of the project, images of this project.</code></li></ul></blockquote></li><li>Contact Us Page, as mentioned above, the following information will be included:<blockquote><ul><li>Suggestion bar</li><li>Google maps for the location of RiceApps</li><li>Chair email and phone number</li><li>RiceApps email</li></ul></blockquote></li>
 <li>Events page telling people times, places, and descriptions of the upcoming events and past events of RiceApps.</li>
 <li>FAQ page with frequently asked questions and answers.</li></ol>
