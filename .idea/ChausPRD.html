    <h1>Coffee House Scheduler </h1>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>Rice Coffeehouse is a student-run business at Rice University that employs over forty
        employees and serves over 4000 students and faculty. For many at Rice, Coffeehouse serves as a central hub
        on campus to study, meet friends, and get caffeinated. As a result, Coffeehouse must hire a lot of student
        employees, formally known as “Keepers of Coffee” (KOC’s, aka baristas), to meet their high demand. As a
        student-run business, student employees often have busy schedules during the academic year, making it difficult
        to schedule appropriate shifts for all employees while still meeting the required number of employees per hour
        to keep Coffeehouse running smoothly. As a result, a large responsibility falls upon a student manager each
        semester to manually schedule student employees such that it caters to the busy schedules of student employees,
        yet satisfy the demanding business operations of the coffee shop. We approximate that over 40+ hours is spent
        on the scheduling process each semester. Our team hopes to reduce this number ten-fold and eventually create an
        application that fully automates the entire scheduling process. This way, Coffeehouse can spend more of their
        time improving campus life and adding to the diverse culture at Rice University.

    <ol style="font-size: 18px"><h3>Scheduling Process</h3>
            <li>
              KOCs scheduled at the beginning of semester to work certain shifts every week.
            </li>
            <li>
              Four weeks into semester, new schedule is created to include new hires.
            </li>
            <li>
              Throughout the semester, shifts are traded over the Coffeehouse listserv.
            </li>
            <li>
              Repeat process each semester.
            </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <p>
        <ul><h3>Timeline (40-50+ hours):</h3>
            <li>A month before semester begins:
              <ul>
                <li>Manager sends out google form to all employees</li>
                <li>Employees fill out google worksheet (10-15 min/employee)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Availability (1-4, 1: Would prefer, 2: Ambivalent, 3: Would prefer not to, 4: Cannot)</li>
                    <li>Additional information (min/max hours, special requests, preferences, etc)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Manager imports raw data into various google sheets</li>
                <li>Manager begins scheduling process (10-12 hours for manager)</li>
                <li>Manager sends schedule to employees via email</li>
                <li>Employees submit trade request via email (2-3 hours for manager)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        <li>Once the semester starts:
        <ul>
          <li>Permanent and temporary trades continue, manager modifies the schedule based on these updated requests
            (30 min for manager)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>4 weeks into the semester:
          <ul>
            <li>A new schedule is required to include new hires</li>
            <li>Entire scheduling process repeats itself (21 hours for manager)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Rest of the semester:
          <ul>
            Permanent and temporary trades continue, manager modifies the schedule based on these updated requests (5 hours for manager)
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
  <br>

    <ol style="font-size: 18px"><h3>Current Scheduling Steps/ Shift Prioritization:</h3>

            <li>
                Fill Tuesday/Thursday 9-11 am slot
                <ul>
                  Tuesday and Thursday classes are difficult to schedule around
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill Monday/Wednesday/Friday 9-11 am slot
                <ul>
                  Employees don’t like doing morning shifts
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill closing shifts (they are low demand)
                <ul>
                  No one likes to be on closing shifts
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill 1-5pm slots for all days
                <ul>
                  Busiest time of the day
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill out the first of the remaining slots
            </li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    <ul><h3>Current Process of Trading Shifts:</h3>
        <li>
          Email is sent out to all employees showing the schedule
        </li>
        <li>
          Employees can request to temporarily or permanently trade shifts with other employees via email if they have a conflicting shift
        </li>
        <li>
          Employees will negotiate via email with other employees and see if they can trade shifts
        </li>
        <li>
          Employees notify manager to receive approval and then, fill out a form (form necessary for splitting tips monthly)
        </li>
        <li>
            Manager goes through data received from forms and manually calculates the change in the net work hours for the employees who traded
        </li>
        <li>
            In the case of a temporary change, the schedule itself is not changed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <ul><h3>Number of employees per shift</h3>
        <li>
          The number of employees per shift depends on Coffeehouse’s business during the specified time slot
        </li>
        <li>
          Example: shifts 1pm-5pm would require 4-5 people whereas shifts 5pm-7pm would require 3 people
        </li>
        <li>
          Opening / Closing: 2 required
        </li>
        <li>
          8 - 9am: 2 required
        </li>
        <li>
          9am - 1pm: 3 required
        </li>
        <li>
          1 - 5pm: 5 required
        </li>
        <li>
          5 - 7pm: 3 required
        </li>
        <li>
          7 - 11pm: 3 required
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Part 1: Scoping</h2>
        <h3>Problem: The current Rice Coffeehouse shift scheduling and trading system is time-consuming, unintuitive, and prone to human error.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
              Shift scheduling data is gathered through a Google Survey sent out to each employee and managed using several Google Excel worksheets.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Coffeehouse scheduling manager must navigate between these worksheets to scan for information when creating the semester’s schedule.
            </li>
            <li>
              Problems with managing data in Google worksheets:
            <ul>
                <li>
                  Data visualization:
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                        It is tedious to scan through multiple dense spreadsheets
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Semester’s schedule cannot be displayed in a clean, elegant format
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Employees are unable to see their personal schedules in a calendar view
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Error prone:
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                        Conditional formatting means 1 single error can make data unusable
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Difficult to check for mistakes when creating the schedule e.g. A misspelled name leads
                        to untracked hours for an employee
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Time consuming:
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                        New incoming Coffeehouse managers invest too much time to learn the complex scheduling process
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Our solution to the problem rests on finding a way to represent this data. Questions to answer:
            <ul>
                <li>
                  What is the best way to represent all this data efficiently?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How do we keep track of all the metrics required?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How do we prioritize data so that the scheduling manager can do their job efficiently?
                </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            What alternatives are out there?:
          <ul>
              <li>
                Sling: Manual shift scheduler

                    <li>
                      Con/Problem: cannot implement rules and constraints specific to scheduling chaus managers,
                      $$$$ subscription plan, no automation
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                      Pros: same as Sling
                    </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                General problem with alternatives: These alternatives are not tailored for the specific needs of chaus.

    </ul>

    <h3>What is the most important thing for our users?</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Most important: Correctness ⇒ The schedule needs to adhere to rules/guidelines such as:

        <li> Each shift must have a minimal number of employees scheduled</li>
        <li> An employee ideally should not work two separate shifts in one day</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
      <li>
        Second most important: Ease of use ⇒ our UI design and flow needs to be user-friendly and
        flexible for managers to schedule shifts as they desire</li>
    </ul>

        <!--<h4>Choose the more important features to implement:</h4>-->
        <!--<h4>Break each feature into smaller steps:</h4>-->
        <h4>The MVP:</h4>
        <ol style="font-size: 20px">
            <li>
                Week long schedule that can be viewed by both the employees and the manger that display how full
                each shift is. Colors represent how full each shift is.
            </li>
            <li>
                Manager will have the ability to edit the master schedule. They will see a list of available/already booked
                employees when they click on a particular shift and can add/remove employees.
            </li>
            <li>
                Managers will receive a warning if they attempt to schedule an employee that is listed as unavailable for
                that specific slot or if they attempt to book an employee for more than one consecutiveshift for one day.
            </li>
            <li>
                A trading mechanism will allow employees to exchange shifts. This will be a form that will automatically
                process the trade in the backend, updating the employees' availability and their total hours booked
                for that week.
            </li>
            <li>
                The backend of the application will keep track of the total number of hours each employee has worked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Elastic Search will be implemented to our databases in order to allow for a more robust and efficient
                way to look through and process data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Friday at 5pm, the hours for each employee in the backend will reset, and the display will change to show
                the next weeks employee availabilities.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Prototypes</h4>
        <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li>Prototype 0: Already Implemented</li>
            <li>Prototype 1:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The backend will be update to accommodate new required fields:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Total working hours for each employee
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Total working hours (cap) for the week for the user
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Min hour, max hour per week
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Elastic Search will be implemented to allow faster and more robust data querying.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Front-end modal shows manager editing shifts proper information about employees. Accomponyig
                    React components / Redux states and actions.
                </li>
                </ol>
                <li>Prototype 2:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Manager will receive popup warning when scheduling a booked employee or double booking.
                        This will require incorporating back-end data and implementing the front end visuals for
                        the popup.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Total hours get reset after each week. This means the backend data will have to undergo a shift
                        after a certain period of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trading forms work properly and update the backend data. Requires implementing a form on the
                        front-end that allows employees to fill out various data entries that then moodift the backend
                        data once an employee submits the form.
                    </li>

                        Deploy MVP. Set up proper hosting for both front end and backend data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Test the Application. Make sure the application works without bugs and that all features listed
                        above are properly implemented.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Beta Testing at Coffeehouse. Have the scheduling manager and
                        Coffeehouse employees use the application. Receive feedback by speaking to users and collecting
                        data.
